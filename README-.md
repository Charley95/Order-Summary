### The challenge
This is an order summary page.
Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned
I practised more on flexbox and saw how easy it is in making your website organised and more responsive.
I encountered this challenge of my image in a div leaving a space
just below the div, i finally troubleshooted and got it perfectly fixed.
I wil continue making use of flexbox where necessary to further improve my skills on it and to produce beautiful looking and functional websites.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```.blue-img {
    border-radius: 20px 20px 0 0;
    vertical-align: bottom;  
```


### Continued development.
I want to continue improving my HTML and CSS skills while also building my JavaScript and React skills.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for reference reasons. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is an amazing website which helped me to get solutions to some of the problems I encountered during the project. I'd recommend it to anyone in the programming world.
